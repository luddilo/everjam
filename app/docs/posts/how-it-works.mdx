summary: "How it works"
---

- The studio
  - 20m2, tatami mats (in future linoleum on top)
  - 240cm ceiling so limited flying abilities, but the ceiling is very much walkable if you play with gravity and a friend. ;-)
  - The space is non-verbal except for concious sharings etc
- Jams
  - The studio is "always" open (excluding hours that are blocked by the resident)
  - Each jam has space for 6 dancers (including one space-holder)
  - Anyone can suggest a jam through this website.
  - Once a jam is suggested it gets posted to a Telegram channel
  - A jam will then happen if someone signs up as space-holder
  - The space-holder decides the soundscape of the jam (speakers are available)
  - The cost of a jam is on a sliding scale 1-5EUR per hour, paid in cash. You decide if you round up or down.
    - Half of the cost goes to the space-holder, half to the studio rental
- Space holder
  - Holds space during a jam
  - A space holder gets the code/key to open the door
  - Collects money from participants
  - To become a space-holder, [talk to Ludvig](mailto:ludvig.linse@gmail.com)
- Residency
  - Residency program for 1-2 people at a time
  - A resident gets to live in central Barcelona at a discounted rate in return for helping out with the project.
