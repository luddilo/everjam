summary: "How it works"
---

- Jams
  - Hourly slots ("always open" with some slots blocked by the resident)
  - Silent by default unless the space-holder decides otherwise
  - Can happen anytime the studio is open given that a space holder is present
  - Simple web page (this one) for signups.
  - Each jam has one space-holder, 5 dancer spots
  - A jam is happening if a space-holder is present
  - The cost of a jam is on a sliding scale 1-5EUR per hour, paid in cash. You decide if you round up or down.
  - Half of the cost goes to the space-holder, half to the studio rental
- Space holding
  - A space holder gets the code/key to open the door
  - Collects money from participants
  - Holds space during a jam
  - To become a space-holder, [talk to Ludvig](mailto:ludvig.linse@gmail.com)
- Residency
  - Residency program for 1-2 people at a time
  - A resident gets to live in central Barcelona at a discounted rate in return for helping out with the project.
  - Read more on the [residency page](residency).
- The space
  - 25m2, tatami mats (in future linoleum on top)
  - 240cm ceiling so limited flying abilities, but the floor is very much walkable if you play with gravity and a friend. ;-)
  - Bathroom with shower
  - Speaker
