summary: "Residency program"
---

- Two people can live in the living space of the studio
- Each residency is 1-3 months
- A resident is responsible for
  - Keeping the studio clean
  - Being a space-holder at least once every week
  - Blocking hours when the studio is closed (for example if they want privacy during sleep)
  - Watering plants
  - Taking care of the resident cat whenever he is around (at least a half-time job ;-))
  - Key logistics and laundry to the next resident
- Cost
  - The idea is to make residency cost-efficient, so we will have a sliding scale from 400 EUR to 1550 EUR (the actual cost of the apartment)
- Living
  - ~45m2 + 15m2 private terrace
  - 180x210 bed in the main room
    - no blinds currently exists, so a sleeping mask is a good idea if you are sensitive to light
  - 105x200 bed in the nouk
  - Sofa bed for 1-2 guests
  - Lots of plants
  - Gas kitchen, washing machine, coffee machine, Amazon Echo/Alexa
  - Cleaner coming bi-weekly
