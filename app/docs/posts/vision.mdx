summary: "A contact improvisation dream"
---

Everjam is my dream. After falling in love with contact improvisation, I wanted to create a space where jamming can happen anytime. A church of contact, always open. When I found an apartment in Barcelona where I could create a dance space I felt I had to give this dream a go. Test it out. It is a social experiment, especially since Barcelona already has a lot of Contact improvisation jams and classes. But I think life is too short to not pursue ones dreams, yeah?

Imagine many of these spaces around the world of various types. They are likely in places where people move in and out. They are calm oasises where one can go to be in their bodies. They bridge cultures by offering residencies for people living in other places, sprinkling their flavour of the practise to the local crowd.
