summary: "A contact improvisation dream"
---

Everjam is my dream. After falling in love with contact improvisation, I wanted to create a space where jamming can happen anytime. A church of contact, always open. When I found an apartment in Barcelona where I could create a dance space I felt I had to give this dream a go. Test it out. It is a social experiment, especially since Barcelona already has a lot of Contact improvisation jams and classes. But I think life is too short to not pursue ones dreams, yeah?

- An always-open, residential contact impro studio in Gracia, Barcelona
- Jams
  - Hourly slots
  - Can happen anytime the studio is open given that a space holder is present
  - Simple web page (this one) for signups. Anyone can sign up.
  - Each jam has one space-holder, 5 dancer spots and one musician spot
  - Sign ups can be named or private
  - A person can sign up for unlimited amount of spots for any given jam
  - A jam is happening if a space-holder is present
  - The cost of a jam is on a sliding scale 1-5EUR per hour, paid in cash. You decide if you round up or down.
  - Half of the cost goes to the space-holder, half to the studio rental
- Space holding
  - A space holder gets the code/key to open the door
  - Collects money from participants
  - Holds space during a jam
  - To become a space-holder, [talk to Ludvig](mailto:ludvig.linse@gmail.com)
- Residency
  - Residency program for 1-2 people at a time
  - A resident gets to live in central Barcelona at a discounted rate in return for helping out with the project. 
  - Read more on the [residency page](residency).
- The space
  - 25m2, tatami mats (in future linoleum on top)
  - 240cm ceiling so limited flying abilities, but the floor is very much walkable if you play with gravity and a friend. ;-)
  - Bathroom with shower
  - Speaker
