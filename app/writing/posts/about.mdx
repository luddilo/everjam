Everjam the project

- An always-open contact impro studio in Gracia, Barcelona
- Jams
  - Hourly slots
  - Can happen anytime the studio is open given that a space holder is present
  - Simple web page (this one) for signups. Anyone can sign up.
  - Each jam has one space-holder, 5 dancer spots and one musician spot
  - Sign ups can be named or private
  - A person can sign up for unlimited amount of spots for any given jam
  - A jam is happening if a space-holder is present
  - The cost of a jam is on a sliding scale 1-5EUR per hour, paid in cash. You decide if you round up or down.
  - Half of the cost goes to the facilitator, half to the studio rental
- Space holding
  - A space holder gets the code/key to open the door
  - Collects money from participants
  - Holds space during a jam
  - To become a space-holder, talk to Ludvig
- Residency
  - One or two people can live in the living space of the studio
  - Each residency is 4-6 weeks
  - A person can apply to any number of residencies
  - A resident is responsible for
    - Blocking hours when the studio is closed (for example if they want privacy during sleep)
    - Being a space-holder at least once every week
    - Keeping the studio clean
    - Watering plants
    - Taking care of the resident cat (at least a half-time job ;-))
    - Key logistics to the next resident
  - The idea is to make residency cost-efficient, so we will have a sliding scale from 400 EUR to 1550 EUR (the actual cost of the apartment)
    - Stipends exist, contact us
- The space
  - Key: available in lock-box
  - Cleaner coming bi-weekly
  - Studio
    - 25m2, tatami mats (in future linoleum on top)
    - 240cm ceiling so limited flying abilities, but the floor is very much walkable. Play with it ;-)
    - Changing room
  - Living
    - 40m2 + 15m2 private terrace
    - 180x210 bed
    - Sofa bed for 1-2 guests
    - Very light (no blinds currently exists, so bring sleeping masks)
    - Lots of plants
    - Gas kitchen, washing machine, coffee machine, Amazon Alexa
